# The Void

Type: Room

## Description

You are in space. Well, it feels like space. Is this what space feels like?

All around you are floating green characters. Are you in the Matrix? You have no idea what they mean. In the distance, you think you can see something else but you aren't sure.

Suddenly, you look down. You see a hole. Maybe you can get out through it.
