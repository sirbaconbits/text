#The Old Shack

Type: Room

## Description

You find yourself in what appears to be a one-room shack. 

The walls are warped and spiderwebbed with cracks. Why would someone ever want to live here?

There are only two defining characteristics in this room--an old wooden radio covered in dust, and a suspicious looking trapdoor.

Maybe it leads nowhere. Maybe it leads to adventure. There's really only one way to know.
